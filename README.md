## Blender process
firstly we have to choses the right model to process it on blender using its features. I'm going to put the right steps I took to generate a Mesh-Divided heart model 
1. Import the right model
   - you can build a heart model in belnder or just select it from any library on google
   - open blender and import your model
2. Select the knife
   - start cutting off your heart model into multiple pieces
   - don't move the parts away, keep them united. you will need them as one unit in unity 
   - make the edges smooth and seamless (you can search to find the right way)

3. Exprot your model
   - after finishing the whole work on blender, export you file into .fbx
   - keep your model in a safe place
